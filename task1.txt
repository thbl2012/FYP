Do 100-10000 wild type simulations with different random seeds.
Change charges to the following: 
2 2 2 2 2...
0 0 0 0 0 ...
2 -2 2 -2 2 -2 ...
Find some way to interpolate to 0 2 0 -2 ...
Do also do 1000 simulations for each mutant
Get data
Create a neural network to classify each type of mutant based on their matrices
